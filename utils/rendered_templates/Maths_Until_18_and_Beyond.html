        <h1>Maths Until 18 and Beyond</h1>

        <article>
            <p>Recently, mathematics has played a central role in UK discourse after Rishi Sunak announced he wanted to make the subject compulsory for everyone under 18. This led to a number of newspaper sub editors (who, probably, are quite number-shy) using the same pun through all their article titles (as seen done by Mitchell, the FT, the Guardian again). </p>
            <p>These articles come from a range of people, including the public face of mathematics in the UK Hannah Fry and comedian-turned-contributor David Mitchell, with parents and teachers also adding their two cents.</p>
            <p>A lot of these articles follow the same beats, there’s a lot of discussion about how it will traumatize people who wouldn’t want to do maths anyway, followed by a brief pointing out of the fact that being useless at maths is such a socially accepted thing in this country. </p>
            <p>Also added in is the fact that in practical terms, the UK doesn’t seem to have a lot of cash in the bank at the moment and is currently understaffed on Maths teachers as is. Comments are also made about how current maths courses need a rehaul.</p>
            <p>Additionally, there is a heavy emphasis on the fact that the world is becoming more 'data-driven', so, it is argued, we need to make children more numerically literate to make sure that our economy can compete globally. As a Data Scientist and ex-Mathematics student, I wanted to also contribute to the conversation.</p>
            <p>I want to place heavy, heavy emphasis on the fact that social attitudes towards mathematics as a subject contribute massively to dissuading people from following mathematics further. During all my years telling family members that I was studying maths, I got told one of two things. It would always be one of 'you must be very clever!' or 'I could never do maths'. </p>
            <p>Even from the beginning of education, we tell people that it is okay to be bad at maths, why are we not trying to teach people to be better than the previous generation were instead? Mathematical resilience should be something we’re emphasising more, not actively eroding. </p>
            <p>The other huge social issue maths faces is the prevalence of the question 'what can this be used for in daily life?'. This question, to me, is of the same vein as the 'why doesn’t school teach me how do do my taxes?' question, as both miss the point about what education actually is.</p>
            <p>Education, in my mind, should be about making people interested in learning and teaching people how to learn. So what if the maths taught isn’t applied? It develops the abilities of children to reason through logical problems and deal with more abstract concepts, something that underpins a lot of problems they will go through.</p>
            <p>The world is an interesting place and every subject gives us a different insight into it. Currently, the UK education system feels very much like a box-ticking exercise and a way to keep children busy, which is probably why most people hate school (and maths along with it!)</p>
            <p>A question that is not being asked is, what does this policy say about Sunak’s attitude towards the humanities subjects? During my undergrad, I took philosophy as well. Again, this dealt with extracting key information about abstract ideas and communicating their pros and cons via paper or vocally in a seminar, skills which underpin many humanities subjects and tasks in daily life. </p>
            <p>The argument needs to be reframed to discuss the skills that subjects offer and making sure we give every child the best opportunity to develop those skills. </p>
            <p>Even if we were not to reframe the conversation in terms of skills, almost every part of the maths syllabus has applications in industry. Numerical methods help in building physics engines for games, linear algebra and statistics see countless uses throughout data science. Differentiation and integration are used almost everywhere in physics and engineering.</p>
            <p>This is great if you’re wanting to go into anything STEM-related, but for humanities students we only seem to be emphasising the fact that it will help them understand data and statistics more. Does this really need them taking an entire maths course post-GCSE?</p>
            <p>Psychology and Geography A-Level courses already have components which covers some statistical tests, why do we need mathematics to do all the heavy lifting for something rather tangential to the rest of the subject? Even now, I know people working in data science who did Archaeology and Psychology degrees. This could be expanded on to solve Sunak’s problem!</p>
            <p>Leaving some more advanced parts of the theory (continuous random variables) are probably best left to maths, however other subjects can definitely help to teach key statistical concepts. Data literacy is also something left out of these conversations, something I think is key in our current age of rampant online misinformation.</p>
            <p>The final point I want to mention before ending this is the fact that no one knows what maths is really for. Is it solely for using in applications? Or is it just trying to find general patterns in the universe? This is an entire rabbit hole that philosophers have argued over for centuries, the purpose and being of maths.</p>
            <p>It is not worth jumping into that rabbit hole here, but it is worth pointing to it and asking whether this causes some of the issues we see in deciding what a good maths syllabus looks like and how best we teach maths to children. While we obsess over its use in helping us with the 'data-driven' future, we’ve got to appreciate mathematics as a subject in its own right.</p>
