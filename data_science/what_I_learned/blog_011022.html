         <h1>What I learned 01/10/22: Classical ML's virtues, Ethical A.I. and slogans...</h1>
        <p>I completed the first week of my first job fresh out of Uni. I’m very happy to be employed as a Data Scientist, everyone I’ve met so far has been very helpful and the office culture is ideal. I wanted to offer things that were highlighted to me about Data Science by introductory talks and experienced colleagues.</p>
        <h2>Data Science is not only about technical knowledge, but also domain knowledge.</h2>
        <p>I think it is quite easy to get drowned in technicalities when trying to learn how to answer Data Science interview questions. With so much to learn in terms of Maths, computer science and programming, you forget that Data Science still carries all the (positive!) traits of being a soft science as well. Industry knowledge is just as important, as well as knowledge and experience of what can cause issues causing biases in Data Science models.</p>
        <h2>Data Scientists come from a wide variety of backgrounds</h2>
        <p>This week, I’ve met a number of other data scientists for the first time. While I’ve met a number of people who have degrees in Maths, Statistics and Computer Science, I’ve also met people whose degrees were in Archaeology and Psychology. You can get into the profession through many degrees! </p>
        <h2>Ethical A.I. Considerations are less tedious than I first thought</h2>
        <p>I did a Mathematics and Philosophy undergraduate degree, I blame that for my internal eye rolls when I used to hear the phrase “Ethical A.I.”. However, these are actually massive considerations made within companies whenever they use A.I. This can be due to something as mundane as maintaining transparency with both customers and regulators. I think the issue I’ve had with Ethical A.I. talks hosted by University societies is that people go into Sci-Fi conversations quite quickly. A number of conversations should be based on the case studies of companies using A.I. at the moment and their impacts.</p>
        <h2>Classical ML models are not going anywhere anytime soon</h2>
        <p>This is a follow-up to the above, as well as a general point about how academia and industry vary in how they present ML models. While research seems to be about making sure Neural Networks are as accurate as possible, there’s a lot to be said in industry for using classical ML models in order to increase explainability and transparency. They’re not worth dismissing as they still have their virtues. </p>
        <h2>As a Data Scientist, you are always learning</h2>
        <p>No Data Scientist knows everything that you need to know. Each project is so different that it requires a different toolkit and new skills to be learned. With the tech also evolving so rapidly, professionals are constantly on their toes. As someone who considered a PhD quite strongly, I’m glad technical research is firmly entrenched in my role.</p>
        <h2>I’m glad people are sick of the same Data Science slogans that I am</h2>
        <p>I am sick of having quoted at me that Data Science was called the “Sexiest Job in the 21st Century”. I’m glad to have colleagues who agree about this. It’s just an utterly bizarre quote; what the hell does it mean? Is it about how it sounds like a ‘sexy’ job?</p>
        <p> I tell people that I do data science and they react with confusion, not arousal. </p>
