        <h1>Industry Insights: Cloud Computing</h1>

        <article>
            <p>Recently for work, I had to take an exam in how Google Cloud Platform works. But what is cloud computing? Why does it matter? Why are companies in the UK now moving their systems to cloud tech? Why is this not really covered in universities? All questions I will try and answer as best I can!</p>
            <p>The idea with cloud computing is that if I am a company who wants to perform tasks which are heavy on computing and I don’t necessarily have all the resources on premises, then I can connect to a different computer provided by a different company which has the ability to do the heavy computational tasks I wish to do.</p>
            <p>Consider as an example that I want to train a neural network in an image recognition task, however I don’t have a computer equipped with a GPU that will do the job in a timely fashion. To solve this issue, I could connect to a cloud provider’s computer (which is then referred to as a ‘virtual machine’ which does have a GPU and use that to train my neural network instead.</p>
            <p>Currently the two market leaders in the field of providing cloud computing are Microsoft Azure (known colloquially as Azure) and Amazon Web Services (AWS). Google, Oracle and IBM all offer cloud platforms as well. AWS has been available since 2002, Google Cloud Platform (GCP) since 2008 and Azure since 2010. IBM/Oracle got into the scene during the 2010s. </p>
            <p>A major advantage of cloud computing is the ability to have your workloads automatically managed. If you have a web app which does not receive as much traffic during night-time hours, then the computing power being dedicated to the app can automatically scale down to accommodate this change. Thus, as well as being able to provide resources, you can also make sure you’re not using too many.</p>
            <p>A lot of this article so far has been singing the praises of cloud computing, however it’s been around for nearly 20 years – why have people not picked it up so much? Why is it not taught in universities?</p>
            <p>The first question is a bit harsh – it is now being widely picked up (ish) but I’ve got serious tunnel vision due to being in a big company in a heavily regulated industry – this naturally can lead to bottlenecks when it comes to adopting new technology due to the risk-averse nature of higher-ups.</p>
            <p>Lots of smaller companies and start-ups in less heavily regulated industries have been using cloud computing to its fullest extent. Google’s recently acquired AI specialist firm Anthropic have been using GCP a great deal, something championed by Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian when the acquisition went through. Other industries that have adopted cloud tech include sports analytics and automotive industries.</p>
            <p>A big risk seen by companies is data security, which is a natural concern. Why should I store the data of my customers on Amazon/Microsoft/Google services? How do I know these companies won’t do anything nefarious with it?</p>
            <p>Solutions have been offered by these companies, the data can be encrypted in a way such that the cloud provider doesn’t have the key to decrypt the data. However, this does little to stop higher-ups still feeling cautious when it comes to offloading data elsewhere – for other regulatory reasons. Additionally, the worst case scenarios may be having your data and developing platform held to ransom – either maliciously or because your cloud platform of choice is down due to some error.</p>
            <p>Other problems occur even after cloud is adopted. You need to upskill your staff or hire new people. Additionally for this, you need learning resources which give practical experience. In my experience with GCP’s ’Associate Cloud Engineer’ exam, it is good at giving you a high level overview of what is going on but it’s very difficult to get hands-on with it.</p>
            <p>This is due to cloud being a pay-as-you-go service where you rent computing resources, therefore to train you up properly in practical experience, it has to give you some form of this for free. The way this is done in google cloud is ‘quiklabs’, where you copy and past things into the command line and have to rush because you’re given a time limit of one hour.</p>
            <p>Additionally, GCP has many services that all work in tandem, so even when you learn about one topic, it is simultaneously working with so many other fundamental parts of the cloud that you have to accept there will be things you have to learn about later. It’s very much like a web, every part of it connects to multiple other parts.</p>
            <p>Additional to all this, there’s an underlying ethical question at hand here. Is it right that we should be handing infrastructure of these companies to big tech? This is, thankfully, a question above my paygrade. I wonder how attitudes towards this may change over time.</p>
            <p>Why has it not been taught much at university? The above issue with quiklabs will be one reason, the other will be that academic staff might not use it. This might be due to the fact that Computer Science departments at university are already likely to have high computational power at their disposal in-house.</p>
            <p>Cloud Computing is here to stay – it would be sensible for anyone wishing to break into the industry to become somewhat aware of it (even if it’s just knowing that it exists and potential employers will be using it). Additionally, more senior engineering jobs/ data science/ data engineering jobs are asking for it, so anyone in the industry may feel the need to get some experience in it.</p>
