         <p>Here are articles on topics/tech that I think are important in industry but overlooked in the academic world, listed in alphabetical order. They will be timestamped so I can't be accused of outdated perspectives.</p>
         <p>I want these to give you a perspective of what these mean to someone like me whose main role involves engineering, instead of the high-level view you might get from a manager.</p>
