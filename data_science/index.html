         <p>As a (Graduate) Data Scientist, I have things to say about Data Science. Here is where I will post anything relevant!</p>
         <ul>
            <li>I have recently started my job in Data Science. I want to blog things I learn about data science in industry, find the blogs <a href = "/data_science/what_I_learned/">here</a>.</li>
            <li>A fair amount of friends I have who are studying their undergrads do ask me how I learned to code/Data Science etc. <a href = "/data_science/learning_data_science.html">This will hopefully answer those questions in text form!</a></li>
            <li>Here are <a href = "/data_science/what_I_wish_I_knew/">a list of things</a> I wish I knew about before getting a data science job.</li>
         </ul>
