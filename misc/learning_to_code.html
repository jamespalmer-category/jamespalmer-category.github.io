         <h1>Learning Data Science (and learning to code)</h1>
         
         <h2>Initial steps (building up to your own project!)</h2>

         <p>Among STEM students, a great deal will end up in some form of technical job. While trying to find a job in Data Science, this is what I used to learn about it. All the courses I've listed are free (at time of writing!)</p>
         <p>Initially, you'll want to learn python. I used the Kaggle course, which you can find <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/learn/python">here</a>. For those wanting Data Science specifically, there are many more courses to also be found <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/learn/">here</a>.</p>
         <p>Additionally, a good portion of companies offering Graduate roles will want some knowledge of SQL. Learning this after Python is very doable, I'd recommend doing so using Datacamp's course found <a href = "https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/introduction-to-sql">here</a>.</p>
         <p>Once you have thought of a project you could use these tools for, I would recommend using <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution">anacondas</a>. This will provide you with Python, a load of Data Science packages, Jupyter Notebook (place to write/run Python - ideal for Data Science), Spyder and a powershell console (useful for commands and downloading additional Python packages), among other things.</p>
         
         <h2>General tips</h2>
         <ul>
             <li><b>Do not feel bad about asking questions! This plagues a lot of STEM students</b>, I found this a lot during my time teaching. People are usually willing to offer their time to answer quick quieries. Ask via Stack Exchange, friends, anyone!</li>
             <li><b>Google is your friend!</b> The stereotype with programmers is that they're very good at googling their issues and finding the solution. During my projects, this helped a lot!</li>
             <li><b>Data Science is a rapidly evolving field, given its dependence on A.I. as well</b>. It can be overwhelming to get into, as there's a lot to learn. You will not learn all of it before any interviews! Just nail the basics (mainly found in the kaggle courses) and then apply your knowledge by doing your own projects.</li>
             <li><b>There are so many things you can apply Data Science & Machine learning to</b>, I chose to apply them to Yu-Gi-Oh and football, as you can find on my GitHub/Kaggle!</li>
         </ul>

         <p>I will add some sort of "FAQ" section here once people ask me questions which aren't addressed above.</p>
