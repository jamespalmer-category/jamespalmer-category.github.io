         <h1>Learning Data Science (from being technically illiterate!)</h1>
         
         <h2>Initial steps (building up to your own project!)</h2>

         <p>Among STEM students, a great deal will end up in some form of technical job. Data Science is one of those jobs which is also ever-growing in popularity. While trying to find a job in it, this is what I used to learn. All the courses I've listed are free (at time of writing!)</p>
         <ol>
         <li>Initially, you'll want to learn python. I used the Kaggle course, which you can find <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/learn/python">here</a>. For those wanting Data Science specifically, there are many more courses to also be found <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/learn/">here</a>.</li>
         <li>Additionally, a good portion of companies offering Graduate roles will want some knowledge of SQL. Learning this after Python is very doable, I'd recommend doing so using Datacamp's course found <a href = "https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/introduction-to-sql">here</a>.</li>
         <li>For interview purposes, you will need a general knowledge of basic statistics, nothing too much more than an introductory course would teach you. I didn't take the course offered by my Uni, so don't worry if you've missed it. I did, however, make sure to find the lecture notes. As I don't want to get into trouble, I won't post those notes here. I imagine with enough googling you'll find a good pdf soon enough. If I find one first, I'll post it here.</li>
         <li>Once you have thought of a project you could use these tools for, I would recommend using <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution">anacondas</a>. This will provide you with Python, a load of Data Science packages, Jupyter Notebook (place to write/run Python - ideal for Data Science), Spyder and a powershell console (useful for commands and downloading additional Python packages), among other things.</li>
         <li>Of course for a Data Science project, you need data to play with. <a href = "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets">Kaggle</a> has a wide variety of datasets. From financial to medical to sport, it has pretty much anything you could ask for (including Yu-Gi-Oh! data!)</li>
         <li>In terms of once you've started your project, or even if you're on the cusp of starting it, then I'd recommend checking out Ken Jee's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2zq7klxX5ASFejJj80ob9ZAnBHdz5O1t">Data Science Project from Scratch Playlist</a>. Ken is a great Data Science content creator who I've watched a lot of and learned a great deal from.</li>
         </ol>
         <p>In terms of importance, learning Python and how to use sklearn and pandas will let you do a lot very quickly. If you're assembling your own data (as I did for my projects, which makes them a lot longer and thus I'm not sure how much I'd recommend for a first project) then you'll want to learn how to use the Selenium/Beautiful Soup packages.</p>
         <p>Once you have a bit of Data Sicence know-how, no matter how small you feel it is, throw yourself into a project! Sometimes taking the leap of faith and accepting your lack of knowledge is the best way to start. A growth mindset is required here. This is just as much about you learning while doing as it is applying what you already know.</p>
         <h2>General tips</h2>
         <ul>
             <li><b>Do not feel bad about asking questions! This plagues a lot of STEM students</b>, I found this a lot during my time teaching. People are usually willing to offer their time to answer quick quieries. Ask via Stack Exchange, friends, anyone!</li>
             <li><b>Google is your friend!</b> The stereotype with programmers is that they're very good at googling their issues and finding the solution. During my projects, this helped a lot! Other browsers are available. Personally, I use Ecosia as well.</li>
             <li><b>If you have a company in mind, check what level of degree they want</b>. A lot of big tech companies want a PhD before you apply, whereas the scheme I'm on only expects a BSc!</li>
             <li><b>Data Science is a rapidly evolving field, given its dependence on A.I. as well</b>. It can be overwhelming to get into, as there's a lot to learn. You will not learn all of it before any interviews! Just nail the basics (mainly found in the kaggle courses) and then apply your knowledge by doing your own projects.</li>
             <li><b>There are so many things you can apply Data Science & Machine learning to</b>, I chose to apply them to Yu-Gi-Oh and football, as you can find on my GitHub/Kaggle!</li>
             <li><b>It is highly likely your University has a number of societies dedicated to A.I./Data Science</b>. Not only will these projects give you experience coding with others, you'll get to know others with similar interests. This will only help you learn more!</li>
         </ul>

         <p>I will add some sort of "FAQ" section here once people ask me questions which aren't addressed above. I appreciate that (for those technically illiterate like I was at the start) that this is a lot of linguo thrown at you very quickly, if you have questions on what certain technical terms mean then I'll make sure to build a glossary.</p>
