             <li>Random things will be here when I want to post about them. For now, please enjoy this picture of me and Tigger (my favourite cat from the Coventry cat cafe)</li>

         <ul>
             <li>A fair amount of friends I have who are studying their undergrads do ask me how I learned to code/Data Science etc. <a href = "/misc/learning_data_science.html">This will hopefully answer those questions in text form!</a></li>
         </ul>
         <p>I made this using Github pages, as well as asking my friend <a href="https://lseem.xyz/">Luca</a> for how he did his website as well (I am well aware, at time of writing, that I've ripped off his CSS code). Check out his website if you're a Geometry enjoyer.</p>
