         <ul>
             <li>I will find my favourite recipes (none of them original, cooking is collaborative and you should aim to share recipes with all your friends) and organise them here (they will all be plant-based for those who love that sort of thing)</li>
             <li>For now though! I would recommend checking out my friend <a href="https://thefruitfulcoach.com/index.php/recipes/">Nicola's recipes here</a> (she's cooked some of them for me before - they are delightful)</li>
