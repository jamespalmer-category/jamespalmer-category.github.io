        <h2>Project Introduction</h2>

        <p>The idea behind the project is to try and use ML to predict the future prices of Yu-Gi-Oh! cards. This is as much of a difficult task to do as it would be for predicting the future prices of anything. However, using game knowledge we can try to add features to the model that will help it see trends in cards based on how certain cards have done in the past/future.</p>
        <p>At our disposal we have a dataset with every card in it from before mid-2020. I could update the algorithm I used to do this for a new website and give myself a better dataset. This first iteration can be found on Kaggle <a href = "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jpalmer2/parsing-yugioh-tcg-data-from-the-yugioh-wiki">here</a>.</p>
        <p><a href= "https://github.com/jamespalmer-category/yugioh-cardmarket-data"></a>Find the GitHub repo for the project here</a>. This might be unnavigable, I'll try to clean it up!</p>
