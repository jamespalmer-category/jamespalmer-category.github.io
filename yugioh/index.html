         <ul>
             <li>Revisit the data cleaning/ parsing I did for card/set data</li>
             <li>Try and get some sort of table you can view here/download with my collection (and what I'm willing to let go of, probably need to link that to cardmarket)</li>
             <li>Try and win a few more games at locals (my records have been 1-0-4 and 1-1-3)</li>
