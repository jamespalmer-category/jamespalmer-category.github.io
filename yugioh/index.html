            <li>I recently came in the Top 64 of Farfa's 2048-player Master Duel Challenge cup. Here's something on this and <a href = 'articles/challenger_cup_report_feb23.html'>Master Duel as a whole</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Ongoing Projects</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Getting Cardmarket price data to be able to track/predict the change in price over time. Find more information of the project <a href="cardmarket_prices_project_reports/">here</a>.</li>
            <li>A Data Engineer <a href="cardmarket_prices_project_reports/">here</a>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Upcoming Projects</h2>
         <ul>
             <li>Revisit the data cleaning/ parsing I did for card/set data (The code here will be utterly utterly grim and I can't garuntee the dataset is particularly clean either, but find both on GitHub/Kaggle accordingly)</li>
             <li>Try and get some sort of table you can view here/download with my collection (and what I'm willing to let go of, probably need to link that to cardmarket)</li>
             <li>Try and win a few more games at locals (my records have been 1-0-4, 1-1-3 and 2-0-3) (UPDATE: I won at a local tournament with my trusty Salamangreats)</li>
         </ul>
